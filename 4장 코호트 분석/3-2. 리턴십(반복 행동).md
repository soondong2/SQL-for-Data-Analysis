### term type이 rep인 id별 first term 날짜 
```sql
SELECT id_bioguide, MIN(term_start) AS first_term
FROM legislators_terms
WHERE term_type = 'rep'
GROUP BY 1
```

### century별 몇 명인지?
- 위 쿼리를 서브쿼리로 사용한다.
- century별 id를 COUNT 한다.
```sql
SELECT
	DATE_PART('century', first_term) AS cohort_century,
	COUNT(id_bioguide) AS reps
FROM (
	SELECT id_bioguide, MIN(term_start) AS first_term
	FROM legislators_terms
	WHERE term_type = 'rep'
	GROUP BY 1
) AS A  -- rep인 경우의 first_term
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

### 임기 타입이 rep와 sen인 경우 century별 몇 명인지?
```sql
SELECT
	DATE_PART('century', A.first_term) AS cohort_century,
	COUNT(DISTINCT A.id_bioguide) AS rep_and_sen
FROM (
	SELECT id_bioguide, MIN(term_start) AS first_term
	FROM legislators_terms
	WHERE term_type = 'rep'
	GROUP BY 1
) AS A  -- rep인 경우의 first_term
	JOIN legislators_terms AS B ON A.id_bioguide = B.id_bioguide
		AND B.term_type = 'sen' AND B.term_start > A.first_term
GROUP BY 1
```

### century별 rep와 rep & sen의 수와 비율
```sql
SELECT
	A2.cohort_century,
	A2.reps,
	B2.rep_and_sen,
	ROUND(B2.rep_and_sen * 1.0 / A2.reps, 3) AS pct_rep_and_sen
FROM (
	SELECT
		DATE_PART('century', first_term) AS cohort_century,
		COUNT(id_bioguide) AS reps
	FROM (
		SELECT id_bioguide, MIN(term_start) AS first_term
		FROM legislators_terms
		WHERE term_type = 'rep'
		GROUP BY 1
	) AS A  -- rep인 경우의 first_term
	GROUP BY 1
) AS A2
LEFT JOIN (
	SELECT
		DATE_PART('century', A.first_term) AS cohort_century,
		COUNT(DISTINCT A.id_bioguide) AS rep_and_sen
	FROM (
		SELECT id_bioguide, MIN(term_start) AS first_term
		FROM legislators_terms
		WHERE term_type = 'rep'
		GROUP BY 1
	) AS A  -- rep인 경우의 first_term
	JOIN legislators_terms AS B ON A.id_bioguide = B.id_bioguide
		AND B.term_type = 'sen' AND B.term_start > A.first_term
	GROUP BY 1
) AS B2 ON A2.cohort_century = B2.cohort_century  -- rep & sen
```
